Here are 4 projects that I have completed over the past year. 
Project 1: I developed a multi-threaded HTTP server using C, which involved creating multiple threads, implementing a bounded buffer, and utilizing mutex locks to ensure an atomic and coherent processes. 
Project 2: I effectively employed Q-learning, depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search algorithms in Python to enhance Pac-Man's gameplay. This optimization was done to improve both its decision-making process and pathfinding for maximum food consumption
Project 3: I built a Slack app using React for the front end, PostgreSQL for the database, and Node JS for the backend. I inserted user data into the database using SQL and retrieved each unique user workspace, channel, and messages through server calls from the backend. The front end was then used to display all this information seamlessly, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience.
Project 4: In this project, I developed unigram, bigram, and trigram language models to predict word sequences. These models were trained to calculate the probabilities of words based on their preceding context. To evaluate the accuracy of these models, I used metrics like perplexity, which measures how well the models predict the next word in a sequence. This approach allowed me to assess the performance of each model in capturing the patterns and structures in the language data.
